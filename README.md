# FindtheQueen

The multiplayer game of Find the Queen was implemented with the Express JS framework and Socket.IO.

To test the project, assuming Node JS is installed. Run the command 'npm i' from the parent folder to add all additional packages. After which 'nodemon index' should run the server.

The authentication and credentials were setup using a mock db file. 
If the testing is interrupted and the credentials stop working, change the mydb.json located in the db folder, user objects 'loggedIn' value/values to false and try again.
